# Founder Ops Workspace

A clean, focused **internal operations tool** built for **non-technical B2B SaaS founders** to manage product progress, users, and day-to-day execution — without relying on scattered tools like Notion, Sheets, or Slack.

This project is designed as a **UI-first internal system**, prioritizing clarity, workflow visibility, and founder decision-making over premature complexity.

---

## The Problem

Early-stage, non-technical SaaS founders struggle with internal visibility:

- Product progress lives in developers’ heads  
- Tasks are spread across Notion, Sheets, and messages  
- User feedback is fragmented across emails and DMs  
- There’s no single place to answer: *“What’s happening right now?”*

This results in:
- Constant context switching  
- Missed priorities  
- Slower execution  
- Founder fatiguem

---

## The Solution

**Founder Ops Workspace** is a private, internal tool that centralizes:

- Product workflow status  
- Operational tasks  
- User visibility and feedback  
- Daily execution priorities  

It provides a **calm, structured workspace** where founders can:
- See what matters today  
- Track progress without asking around  
- Make decisions quickly and move on  

This is not analytics-heavy.  
This is not customer-facing.  
This is **founder operations clarity**.

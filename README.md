# Founder Analytics Dashboard

A clean, focused **analytics workspace** built for **early-stage and non-technical SaaS founders** to understand product health, growth trends, and key business signals — without complex tooling, noisy dashboards, or premature data pipelines.

This project is designed as a **UI-first analytics system** — prioritizing clarity, storytelling, and decision support over raw data volume.

---

## The Problem

Founders often lack clear visibility into how their product is performing:

- Metrics are scattered across tools or not tracked at all
- Early dashboards are either too shallow or overly complex
- Founders can’t quickly answer: *“Are we growing or stagnating?”*
- Analytics tools feel intimidating before real scale

This results in:
- Guesswork instead of insight
- Delayed decisions
- Overreliance on engineers
- Poor product intuition

---

## The Solution

**Founder Analytics Dashboard** provides a calm, opinionated analytics experience that focuses on:

- High-signal KPIs
- Growth trends over time
- Clear breakdowns of what’s changing
- Quick insights without digging

It gives founders a **single page** to:
- Understand business health in seconds
- Spot trends early
- Build intuition around their product’s performance

This is not an enterprise BI tool.  
This is **founder-level analytics clarity**.
